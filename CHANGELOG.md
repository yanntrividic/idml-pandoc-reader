#Â Revision history for idml-pandoc-reader

## idml-pandoc-reader 0.4.0 (to release)

* Mapping functionalities are now written in Lua. That means that they are now format-agnostic, and can work with Pandoc as their only dependency.
* `idml2docbook` was updated to reflect those changes, and is now closer to a simple IDML to DocBook converter.
* JSON mapping structure has changed to comply to the new architecture, operators changed as well.
* Removing the `cut` functionalities for now, as they will be handled in Pandoc as well.

* A `.design` folder and its content now exist to document the design of OutDesign.
* Started working on new Lua filters to apply mapping through Pandoc, and not Python.
* Fixed a bug where paragraph and style names extraction was raising an error if there was an extra IDML layer.

## idml-pandoc-reader 0.2.0 (2025-08-01)
