* **[Pundok Editor](https://github.com/massifrg/pundok-editor)** -- An interesting example of a node-and-content tree structure. However, the tree view feels underutilized for now and doesn't seem to fully take advantage of the structure it represents.

* **[Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/)** -- A clean and user-friendly interface for converting images. For our purposes, it could be adapted to include a final Pandoc command, while replacing the before/after slider (which wouldn't make sense here) with a more relevant comparison or feedback element.

* **[FFmpeg Explorer](https://ffmpeg.lav.io/)** -- A helpful tool for visualizing FFmpeg parameters. In our case, we would want to "group" our parameters more, as it makes complex configurations more accessible for non-expert users.

* **[Try pandoc!](https://pandoc.org/try/)** -- A simple online Pandoc playground. It would be interesting to extend this with bidirectionality: starting from a command, parsing it, and loading corresponding interface presets. This could also serve as a way to save and reload interface states.

* **[Timoth√©e Goguely's HTML Day 2025 Info Page](https://timothee.goguely.com/html-day/2025)** -- A well-structured event page that hints at the deeper, underlying semantic structure of a webpage.
