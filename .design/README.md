# OutDesign Design Notes

Welcome! This folder is here to gather notes around the design of OutDesign, a webapp that will get pluged on top of the IDML Pandoc Reader. It will contain notes, references, design ideas, wireframes and even visual prototypes; and will get more and more furnished as we go deep into the design process.

If you want to contribute to the UX/UI design for this project, this is the place to get started. For additional ressources on how to contribute, please refer to our [contributor guide](https://gitlab.com/deborderbollore/idml-pandoc-reader/-/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

At this point, everything still has to be done ðŸ¤ª

## Objectives

The main goal behind OutDesign is to propose a webapp to customise conversions of IDML files to another target format using Pandoc, and to be able to specify a new semantic structure for the target file in the process.

For example, OutDesign will help turning the IDML file of a book into a webpage that can directly fit the semantic structure of a publishing house website. It can also help design conversion pipelines so that the operations applied by OutDesign are re-integrated into your own publishing workflow.

For more details on this, please refer to the [specs](https://gitlab.com/deborderbollore/idml-pandoc-reader/-/blob/main/.design/SPECIFICATIONS.md) envisioned for OutDesign.
